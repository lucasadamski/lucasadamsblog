                If you want to be like somebody else, you only will be a joke and a copy-cut.

                Lots of things in life are adaptive, in other words - customized to current circumstances, 
                knowledge, history, culture etc. Even the way how we emotionally cope are adaptive, there 
                is no one fixed solution to deal with certain problem. It's important to have a knownledge 
                about life and experience in connecting puzzles together in one correct piece, a piece we 
                call life.

                You might say that you want to make the same movie as Godfather. Even though the director 
                before the release was totally convinced that the picture will be a flop. He heard few 
                times in a bathroom how various co-workers chatted how terrible that movie is. As we
                 know nowadays, this film is regarded as a one of the best in the world. Why? Because 
                 at the moment of making it was groundbreaking. It didn't imitate other movies, it was 
                 made on a different set of rules.            
            </p>

                If somebody would do a identical film as Godfather today, then that movie would be a 
                disaster. Everybody would knew that it's a copy of Godfather and that is off-putting.

                Same goes for the personality and the "wanting to be somebody". Only when you are aware 
                of your surroundings, understand how it affects you and how you can affect your environment 
                - then you have a chance for a breakthrough in your life, a life that you can label a one 
                of  the best lives in the world.
